# Heatmaps (Supplementary script)

You may find it useful to visualise the many matrices that are generated by
this pipeline (especially if the models you are comparing are large). If you do
want to do this, you'll need to run the Rscript generate_heatmap.R like so:

```bash
Rscript .../generate_heatmap.R path/to/matrix path/to/output_file false
```

The third argument here is to let the script know whether or not the supplied
matrix is for emission parameter similarity. This was implemented because a
smaller Euclidean distance (emission parameter similarity) implies two states
are very similar. However, if two states have very high fold enrichment
(spatial similarity), their score will be very high. The fact that these are
opposing each other makes the resultant heatmaps harder to quickly interpret
(as the colours you are looking for are flipped between them).
