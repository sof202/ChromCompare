# ---------- #
# PARAMETERS #
# ---------- #

# Ideally both models were learned with the same bin size in ChromHMM. If you
# did not consciously set the bin size, you can keep this at 200 (default).
# If your models have 2 different sizes, you might want to set this to the
# minimum bin size of the two models.
BIN_SIZE=200

# To account for jitters and inaccuracies in ChromHMM, you can add a margin  
# around each state assignment to assist in showing that two states are 
# spatially  similar between two models. The default is arbitrary and based 
# off of a bin   size of 200. If your bin size is signficantly different, I'd 
# recommend changing  this. Set this to (0) if you don't want to factor in 
# margins.
MARGINS=(0 200 400)

# To give certain similarity metrics more weighting in the final calculation,
# change this variable. Provide a comma separated list where the first value is
# the weighting for emission parameter similarity and the remaining align with
# the spatial similarities obtained for each margin given above.
